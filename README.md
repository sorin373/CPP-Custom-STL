# Introduction

This is my custom implementation of the STL containers and other generic utility components. This really helped me understand many concepts which lay behind generic OOP and I hope using this repository people can understand better how STL containers work behind the scenes.

`Note:` For documentation and development I used [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/). Moreover, I do not guarantee that my aproach is standard conformant. My goal was to take the C-style implementations, which I did in high school (C-Style arrays, matrices, strings etc) and try to abstract as much as I could, of course using the std template as an example.

## Containers

- [array.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/array.h) 
- [vector.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/vector.h)
- [forward_list.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/forward_list.h)
- [unordered_map.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/unordered_map.h)

## Iterators
- [reverse_iterator.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/reverse_iterator.h)

## Other utilities
- [allocator.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/allocator.h)
- [memory.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/memory.h)
- [core.h](https://github.com/sorin373/CPP-Custom-STL/blob/main/src/STL/core.h)
